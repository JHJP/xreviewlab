58278,McDonald's,1,I live in the area and have gone to this McDonald's for years. I love McDonald's so I keep coming back but if you go you should expect your order to be messed up. More often then not the order is just flat out wrong or missing items. And I'm fact there isn't a time in the last year that I can remember they got the order right. If you want McDonald's and your in the area do yourself a favor and go to a different location.,2022-01-17 19:55,1079,87,0,0,1,0,0,0
96739,McDonald's,1,"I sometimes door dash in my spare time and I went to this location before to pick up some food the drive thru line was super long so I parked and walked in the store (the lobby door was unlocked) soon as I walk in I'm bombarded with question ""what you doin in here?"" ""How you get in here"" ""you know the lobby closed huh"" I answer, I'm picking up a order for doordash, the door was unlocked, no I didn't know the lobby was closed cause the door is unlocked"" once I get through the McDonald's interrogation I ask the lady who's talking to me if she can hand me the food because it's sitting right there on the counter and she started to hand it to me then all of a sudden the manager comes all the way from the office to snatch the bag out of my hand and tells me I need to go through the drive thru. But sir... I've already touched the food so whatever it is you're trying to do to abide by safety protocols is already out the window. Long story short instead of arguing with this man I go back outside get in the drive thru line and wait a extra 15 minutes to pick up a order that was already in my hands. I avoid this McDonald's as much as I can. Since I've been in New Orleans the last five years this is hands down the rudest McDonald's out here.",2022-01-17 14:28,1079,251,0,0,0,0,0,0

When I got to the second window to let them know that. It seems like she was mad at me because they didn't get my order right. Ask to speak to the manager and she was even worst than the cashier. And to make things worst. She closed the window on me and walked off. The sad thing about this is , No matter how many bad reviews we write or how many calls we make. McDonald's will never do anything about their bad customer service and hold their people accountable for their actions.  I guess when customers stop spending their money here maybe it will be a wake up call for the employer and employees. The worst location ever! Just read the other reviews.

88098,McDonald's,1,"first off there's a whole family that works at that particular McDonald's. I'm pretty sure that family isn't supposed to work with family. That's a conflict of interest! Some are managers and some are regular staff. They are a bunch of miserable, unhappy people. They are very rude and unprofessional. As a paying customer i should not have to wait for someone to help me when I plainly see 4 managers just standing at the front desk. They don't acknowledge customers and when they do help they have an attitude. Not to mention I witnessed a manager talking down to a staff member! I don't know how they still have a job and how the hire ups think it's ok to run a restaurant  in that manner! The energy they give off there is so depressing! These sort of people are not made for the customer service industry. They must have a pretty unhappy life at home! As the saying goes, misery needs company! After reading other reviews I'm glad to know I'm not the only one that feels this way. But the funny thing is, it's still going on!

My daughter's cheeseburger in her happy meal had onions on it. Never once in all the times we've gotten a cheeseburger happy meal has there been onions on the burgers.

82807,McDonald's,1,"Night shift looks to be leaving the outdoor lights off some nights. Came at 830 pm tonight. Sign on the drive through saying cash only this time. So I didn't even ask about the shake machine. Had to ask if someone was there twice with no response. I was persistent and I would not be deterred of enjoying my beloved Micky Ds. On the third attempt after two minutes waiting someone greeted me. I was basically shouting at a speaker In the dark like a mentally ill person. There was no one in line and no customers in the store. Seemed they didn't want to be bothered. I attempted a friendly exchange while the girl who counted my change but she did not speak. I think the words she uttered were ""uh huh"" It was extremely hard to understand her, sounded like she was chewing on something and underwater at the same time. It also seemed she didn't like the idea of other human lives being in her presence. Felt very unwell and unwelcome. She also looked extremely unwell.... 
The store resembled a dark place, almost like a dark hole that sucks planets into it, never to return. That goes for the lighting and the customer service energy.

Dude at the second window was cool like "" yo bro what's up , have a good night"" 
I said ""you too bro. "" 
... that part felt uplifting so I am thankful for that.

Nope, she just walked away. So ask the cashier to get the manager back. The manager proceeds to tell me there is nothing they can do if the order isn't in their system. She can't be sure via the mobile app that I paid. I proceed to show her the email confirmation which has my credit card information, the authorization code and amount paid. She continues to say there is nothing she can do. Mobile ordering is different from McDonald's. Even though it was the McDonald's app that I used!

I placed my order: 2 Quarter-pounders, 3 apple pies, a 6-pcs nugget, 1 large french fries and a Strawberry-Banana smoothie. I knew I was going to wait a few minutes but more than half an hour later and after everyone who'd come in after me had already left. I finally asked about my order. It was hastily put together. I had let the lady know I was missing the smoothie (but not her fault, she just started her shift and was the only person expediting orders). The ""manager"" was hanging around in the parking lot.

The sign at the drive through still says that if they forget to ask you about MyMcDonalds Rewards, you get a free apple pie.  The young lady at the drive through didn't ask about the rewards program, so I asked for the apple pie.  The angry night manager yelled through the window to me, claiming that they had quit that deal a month ago, and that I could just sit in the drive through until she ""call da police, 'cuz he ain't getting' no apple pie.""  
If that's so, then why have they served me the free apple pie twice in just this last week when they've forgotten to ask me each time?  And why does their drive through sign still say they have that deal if they don't?

And worst of all is the attitude of the employees. They are consistently rude, blaming customers for their mistakes, scolding people for not waiting longer at a vacant window, or simply having a ""please go away"" demeanor.
