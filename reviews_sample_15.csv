58030,McDonald's,1,The young man Devante does not know how to take orders. He is extremely rude was smiling the entire time when I was trying to figure out with the young girl what was happening and had nothing but a snarky attitude I am calling the managers later and corporate. No one was behind me so it's not like they were busy. Disgusting.,2022-01-18 22:29,1078,62,1,0,0,0,0,0
61583,McDonald's,1,"0 stars. You wait in the drive through for nobody to answer, you call the number and nobody answers, you drive up and call the number in the window and nobody answers, you finally walk inside and these pieces of shit are all sitting on their phones lol. Insane.",2022-01-18 12:07,1078,49,1,0,0,0,0,0
82580,McDonald's,1,First they left food out of the drive thru order and had an attitude when I went in to get it. I got home and they put a small soda cup in a large cup instead of filling the large cup.,2022-01-17 23:31,1079,41,0,0,0,0,0,0
58278,McDonald's,1,I live in the area and have gone to this McDonald's for years. I love McDonald's so I keep coming back but if you go you should expect your order to be messed up. More often then not the order is just flat out wrong or missing items. And I'm fact there isn't a time in the last year that I can remember they got the order right. If you want McDonald's and your in the area do yourself a favor and go to a different location.,2022-01-17 19:55,1079,87,0,0,1,0,0,0
96739,McDonald's,1,"I sometimes door dash in my spare time and I went to this location before to pick up some food the drive thru line was super long so I parked and walked in the store (the lobby door was unlocked) soon as I walk in I'm bombarded with question ""what you doin in here?"" ""How you get in here"" ""you know the lobby closed huh"" I answer, I'm picking up a order for doordash, the door was unlocked, no I didn't know the lobby was closed cause the door is unlocked"" once I get through the McDonald's interrogation I ask the lady who's talking to me if she can hand me the food because it's sitting right there on the counter and she started to hand it to me then all of a sudden the manager comes all the way from the office to snatch the bag out of my hand and tells me I need to go through the drive thru. But sir... I've already touched the food so whatever it is you're trying to do to abide by safety protocols is already out the window. Long story short instead of arguing with this man I go back outside get in the drive thru line and wait a extra 15 minutes to pick up a order that was already in my hands. I avoid this McDonald's as much as I can. Since I've been in New Orleans the last five years this is hands down the rudest McDonald's out here.",2022-01-17 14:28,1079,251,0,0,0,0,0,0
39636,McDonald's,1,"Every time you go to this McDonald's it's always a problem. The black lady at the first window did not ring up everything I asked for. When I got to the second window to let them know that. It seems like she was mad at me because they didn't get my order right. Ask to speak to the manager and she was even worst than the cashier. And to make things worst. She closed the window on me and walked off. The sad thing about this is , No matter how many bad reviews we write or how many calls we make. McDonald's will never do anything about their bad customer service and hold their people accountable for their actions.  I guess when customers stop spending their money here maybe it will be a wake up call for the employer and employees. The worst location ever! Just read the other reviews. I wish I could give them no stars.",2022-01-17 14:00,1079,159,1,0,0,0,0,0
88098,McDonald's,1,"first off there's a whole family that works at that particular McDonald's. I'm pretty sure that family isn't supposed to work with family. That's a conflict of interest! Some are managers and some are regular staff. They are a bunch of miserable, unhappy people. They are very rude and unprofessional. As a paying customer i should not have to wait for someone to help me when I plainly see 4 managers just standing at the front desk. They don't acknowledge customers and when they do help they have an attitude. Not to mention I witnessed a manager talking down to a staff member! I don't know how they still have a job and how the hire ups think it's ok to run a restaurant  in that manner! The energy they give off there is so depressing! These sort of people are not made for the customer service industry. They must have a pretty unhappy life at home! As the saying goes, misery needs company! After reading other reviews I'm glad to know I'm not the only one that feels this way. But the funny thing is, it's still going on! They definitely lost my business!",2022-01-17 13:09,1079,195,1,0,0,0,0,0
14723,McDonald's,1,"The worst McDonalds I have ever been to. There are regularly groups of gang members hanging out inside and negotiating drug deals (even though it is ""closed"" for eat in). The employees have bad attitudes and always get orders wrong. The place has trash strewn on the floor. A discredit to the franchise.",2022-01-17 6:15,1079,53,1,0,0,0,0,0
118198,McDonald's,1,"Not a good place to go to if you want to be ripped off. we have attended this place a few times in december and january this year more than usual but over the period of 1.5 years isnt still a good place to go to. Now medowie macdonalds is open i would drive that little bit extra to go there and get a good meal and get what you ordered with a smile. We have had missing drinks, missing hash browns, missing icecreams, ive had to keep telling the young girl this and that is missing after the 3rd time she got pissy at me for it... always waiting bayed and they delete your order and they dont give you what they want because they want their monthly bonuses rather happy returning customers.",2022-01-17 3:54,1079,134,1,0,0,0,0,0
103415,McDonald's,1,Worst McDonald's ever. Every time we get stuff from here it's either messed up or they forget stuff. This trip they almost didn't even give us all our food. My husband had to tell them they forgot our food. Didn't even give the toys they're supposed to be giving. We got Pok??mon stuff. We were expecting Sing 2 or Encanto toys.  My daughter's cheeseburger in her happy meal had onions on it. Never once in all the times we've gotten a cheeseburger happy meal has there been onions on the burgers. And they didn't even give us her juice with her happy meal. Seriously if I could give 0 stars I would!!,2022-01-17 0:50,1079,112,1,0,0,0,0,0

31161,McDonald's,1,"Worst place in town.  Order on the app, show up at 930.  Closed.  They just shut down at any random hours.  When they are ""open"", expect 5o wait a min of 30 minutes if there's 2 or more cars in the drive through.  Oh yeah, they shut down walk in for over a year.  Update your hours people.  Stop wasting everybody's time.",2022-01-16 5:59,1080,62,1,0,0,0,0,0
